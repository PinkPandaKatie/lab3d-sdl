	LAB3D/SDL
	=========

LAB3D/SDL is a port of Ken's Labyrinth to modern operating systems, using
OpenGL for graphics output and the SDL library to provide user input, sound
output, threading, and some graphics support functions. Music output is
through Adlib emulation or MIDI (MIDI only on Windows, Linux and other
operating systems with OSS-compatible sound APIs).

This code has been tested on Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows XP,
SuSE Linux 7.2 and 8.1, Debian Linux 2.2, SunOS 5.8 (Solaris 8) and
FreeBSD 4.7.

Improvements over the original Ken's Labyrinth:

- Runs natively on 32-bit Windows or Unix.
- Supports big-endian CPUs.
- Uses OpenGL to provide hardware accelerated, anti-aliased graphics with
  trilinear interpolation in true colour (where available).
- Multiple simultaneous sound effects.
- Improved General MIDI music.
- Adlib emulation.
- Many bug fixes.

July 1, 2001:

Some people have been pestering me to release the Ken's Labyrinth source
code, so I've decided that it was time to give it out to everyone. This is
the code from the full version of Ken's Labyrinth (LABFULL.ZIP) It is made
to compile in Microsoft C 6.00A (PLEASE NOTE that this is NOT Microsoft
Visual C++ 6.0, but actually an old 16-bit DOS compiler that was released
by Microsoft way back in 1990.) I have never tried compiling the code in
anything else, and I don't even want to think about it, so please don't ask!

KEN'S LABYRINTH SOURCE CODE LICENSE TERMS:                        07/01/2001

[1] I give you permission to make modifications to my Ken's Labyrinth source
    and distribute it, BUT:

[2] Any derivative works based on my Ken's Labyrinth source may be
    distributed ONLY through the INTERNET and free of charge - no
    commercial exploitation whatsoever.

[3] Anything you distribute which uses a part of my Ken's Labyrinth source
    code MUST include the following message somewhere in the archive:

    "Ken's Labyrinth" Copyright (c) 1992-1993 Ken Silverman
    Ken Silverman's official web site: "http://www.advsys.net/ken"

    Including this README.TXT file along with your distribution is the
    recommended way of satisfying this requirement.

[4] Technical support: The code is so old that I am NOT interested in wasting
    my time answering questions about it. If you can't figure out how to
    compile the code, or you can't figure out what the code is doing,
    then that's your problem.
