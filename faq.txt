	LAB3D/SDL FAQ
	=============

Q: Why does LAB3D/SDL crash immediately after starting on my Windows 95/98
machine with a page fault in "OPENGL32.DLL" (and possibly "KERNEL32.DLL")?
A: You are probably running Microsoft's slow, old and buggy software OpenGL
implementation. Install display drivers with OpenGL support; your graphics
card or chipset manufacturer should provide them (e.g. through their web
site).

Q: Why does LAB3D/SDL run slowly on my machine?
A: There are several possible reasons for this. If you don't have a 3D
accelerator, LAB3D/SDL will run very slowly. Similarly, if your system's
OpenGL implementation is not accelerated, LAB3D/SDL will be unable to make use
of 3D acceleration; updating your display drivers may fix this. Finally, you
may be running LAB3D/SDL at an unnecessarily high graphics resolution; lower
it to something like 800x600.

Q: Why doesn't LAB3D/SDL have a fast software renderer like the original Ken's
Labyrinth?
A: Very few computers are sold nowadays without 3D acceleration and most games
require 3D acceleration. Therefore, most people who would play LAB3D/SDL
already have a 3D accelerator. To these people, software rendering is not of
any use. The original Ken's Labyrinth software renderer is very fast but
relies heavily on being able to access specific hardware directly (8086 or
compatible with VGA) in a very specific manner (VGA Mode X, maximum resolution
360x240). A rewritten software renderer may appear in future versions.

Q: Why doesn't LAB3D/SDL support Direct3D?
A: OpenGL is a more widely supported 3D graphics API than Microsoft's
Direct3D. The only case in which Direct3D support would be of use is for users
of graphics accelerators with Direct3D acceleration but no OpenGL
acceleration. I suggest you pester your graphics card or chipset manufacturer
to produce OpenGL drivers or buy a better supported graphics card. Future
versions of LAB3D/SDL may support Direct3D, but don't count on it.

Q: Why doesn't LAB3D/SDL have an automap like Doom, Blake Stone or Descent?
A: Because Ken's Labyrinth doesn't have an automap. Besides, you're supposed
to get lost in labyrinths.
