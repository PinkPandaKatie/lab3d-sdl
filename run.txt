	LAB3D/SDL Usage
	===============

Users of binary packages are provided with scripts "setup" (Linux) and
"setup.bat" (Windows) to run the setup. Alternatively, the "-setup" flag
may be used as described below.

Run the executable file, making sure that the current directory is the
directory in which the data files are residing.

Command-line parameters (these override settings chosen in setup):

-setup			Run setup.
-res <w> <h> <x> <y>	Use <w>x<h> resolution, simulating <x>x<y> 2D screen.
			Note that while w and h are integers, x and y can be
			any floating point numbers >= than 320x200.
-asp <w> <h>		Override aspect correction; <w> and <h> multiply the
			width and height of the 3D viewport; both are
			floating point numbers greater than 0.1.
-win			Run in a window.
-fullscreen		Run in fullscreen mode.
-nearest		No display filtering.
-trilinear		Trilinear display filtering.
-nomusic		Disable music.
-gmmusic		General MIDI music.
-admusic		Adlib emulation music.
-nosound		Disable sound effects.
-sound			Enable sound effects.
-debug			Extended graphics debug output. Only for
			troubleshooting purposes.

To activate cheat codes, the last parameter must be either "snausty" (normal
cheat mode) or "cheaton" (cheat codes use [LSHIFT]-[LCTRL] instead of both
shift keys). Note that cheaters never prosper.

Unrecognised options are ignored.
